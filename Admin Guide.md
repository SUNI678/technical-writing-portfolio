### Prerequisites 

* A Microsoft account
* A Mlicrosoft Advertising account
* A developer token

To get a Microsoft Advertising account, go to https://ads.microsoft.com. If you're not signed in to your Microsoft account, you're redirected to sign in to your account or to sign up for one. After signing in, you'll have the option to Sign up for a new Microsoft Advertising account. Select the sign up option and click Continue.
Next, if you don't already have a Microsoft Advertising developer token for the production environment, go to the Developer Portal. Click Request Token and provide the requested information. If you use the API to manage your own account, you'll receive your token immediately; however, if you're managing accounts for others, it may take up to five business days to get a token.
